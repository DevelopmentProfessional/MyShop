# API Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements made to the API endpoints in `js/server.js` to ensure they are functional, consistent, and up to professional standards.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate API Endpoints**
- **Problem**: Multiple `/api/employees` endpoints existed in the codebase
- **Solution**: Consolidated into a single, comprehensive employees API with proper CRUD operations
- **Impact**: Eliminates confusion and ensures consistent behavior

### 2. **Inconsistent Response Formats**
- **Problem**: Some APIs returned `{success: true, data: ...}` while others returned raw arrays
- **Solution**: Standardized all API responses to use the format:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": [...],
    "message": "..." // for delete operations
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Consistent API contract for frontend consumption

### 3. **Missing Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Many endpoints used generic `handleError()` function or had no error handling
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with:
  - Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
  - Detailed error messages
  - Error logging for debugging
  - Consistent error response format

### 4. **Lack of Input Validation**
- **Problem**: APIs accepted invalid or missing data without validation
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive validation for all endpoints:
  - Required field validation
  - Data type validation
  - Business logic validation
  - Clear error messages indicating missing fields

### 5. **Inconsistent Database Column References**
- **Problem**: Some APIs used `id` vs `employee_id` vs `project_id` inconsistently
- **Solution**: Standardized column references and ensured proper JOIN operations

### 6. **Missing CRUD Operations**
- **Problem**: Some entities only had GET operations
- **Solution**: Implemented full CRUD operations for all major entities:
  - GET (list and single item)
  - POST (create)
  - PUT (update)
  - DELETE (remove)
